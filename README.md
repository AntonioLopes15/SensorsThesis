# Velocity Estimation using Wearable Technology and Deep Learning

Velocity, a fundamental parameter in sports performance, enables the evaluation of exercise effort, particularly power, defined as the product of velocity and known weight. This work presents a novel integration of commercial wearable technology and a specialised performance machine for the estimation of velocity.

## Overview

A high-precision sports performance machine engineered for strength training (M1 MYO-QUALITY) provides real-time data on force, velocity, and power. Through a specially designed application, a commercial wearable device acquires data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) comprising an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Subsequently, our deep learning model, a Convolutional Neural Network combined with a Long-Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM), accurately estimates the velocity in relation to the professional sports machine, thereby facilitating the measurement of this parameter in scenarios where MYO-QUALITY is not accessible to athletes. In addition, a classification of four exercises was carried out to support the incoming research, which yielded excellent results.
